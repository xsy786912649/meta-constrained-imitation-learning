Task: different constraints on same character A
few_shot: No (on a same character, few shot is not meaningful)

Compare: objective function and constraint

Show: meta parameter (meta regularization is also meta initialization) can help avoid bad local minimal 

nonconvex, the initial parameter is very inportant
